Here is what I learnt from [lesson 3](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson3.html) of the FastAI course. 

## What Models are Best?

In this lesson, Jeremy introduces a graph showing the metrics of different architectures. Sometimes its hard to choose a single model to start with since there are over 500 achitectures, however [this graph](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best)[^1], shows the accuracy and speed of each of the fastai models. This useful graph is shown here:
