# Getting Started With **[FASTAI](https://www.fast.ai/)**

Here is what I learnt from [lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html) of the FastAI course. 

In Deep learning you start with a random neural net, feed it examples and it learns to recognise things. The model creates the layers for itself and the deeper you get the more sophiticated the features get. Hence, there is no need to hand code the features as you may do in Machine Learning. This means that recognition we never thought was possible by machines is now easier than ever!

In this lesson, Dr Jeremy Howard demonstrates a 'simple' image based recogniser. He mentions that this recogniser doesn't have to be your general pictures, and can be applied to images of sound waveforms and mouse movements, as well as other time series data forms, to create classification models using the visual learner model. 

For the vast majority of applications, such deep learning does not need lots of data and can be applied to real world projects very simply. FastAI enables state of the art work for *FREE*.
