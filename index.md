**Welcome!**

I'm a final year Electrical Engineering student at UQ, and I'm excited about the potential of deep learning to transform industries. I'm completing the [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai) course on Deep Learning, and I'll be documenting my progress here. I plan on sharing my thoughts on other AI topics, such as natural language processing and computer vision as well!

I hope you'll join me on this journey!
